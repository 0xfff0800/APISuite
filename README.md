In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile deviceâ€™s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.

We will not share any Personal Information that we have collected from or regarding you with any third-party company or business partner.

RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIVICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION
You may inquire as to whether APISuite is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate.

Although APISuite makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise othersâ€™ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individualâ€™s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.

When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
By using the App/Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site.
